# API Overview

The combined REST and GraphQL API offers developers a versatile and comprehensive interface
for interacting with our system's data and services.
By integrating both RESTful and GraphQL architectures, developers can leverage the
strengths of each approach, accommodating various use cases and preferences.

## REST API

Our REST API provides traditional endpoints for accessing resources and performing
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It follows RESTful principles,
utilizing HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE to interact with resources.
With REST, developers can access data through predictable URLs, making it straightforward
to understand and integrate into existing systems. This approach is particularly suitable
for scenarios where clients require specific data or have strict requirements
for resource manipulation.

## GraphQL API

In addition to REST, our API also supports GraphQL, a query language for APIs that allows
clients to request precisely the data they need in a single query.
GraphQL offers a more flexible and efficient alternative to REST by enabling clients to specify
their data requirements and receive tailored responses.
Clients can traverse related resources and retrieve nested data structures in a single request,
reducing the number of round trips to the server and optimizing performance.
This approach is beneficial for applications with complex data requirements or dynamic
user interfaces where fetching multiple resources in a single request is advantageous.

## Key Features

- Flexibility: Developers can choose between REST and GraphQL based on their preferences and project requirements.
- Fine-grained Control: With GraphQL, clients can request only the fields they need, minimizing over-fetching
  and under-fetching of data.
- Predictable Endpoints: RESTful URLs provide a straightforward way to access resources and perform CRUD operations.
- Efficient Data Retrieval: GraphQL reduces the need for multiple API calls by allowing clients to fetch related data in a single request.
- Scalability: Both REST and GraphQL APIs are designed to scale with the growing needs of applications and user bases.
- Documentation: Comprehensive documentation is provided for both APIs, including detailed descriptions of endpoints, query/mutation examples, and data schemas.
- By offering a combined REST and GraphQL API, we aim to provide developers with the flexibility
  and efficiency they need to build powerful and scalable applications while accommodating a variety of development preferences and use cases.
